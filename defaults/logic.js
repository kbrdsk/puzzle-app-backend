    description: `Once upon a time a farmer went to a market and purchased a wolf, a goat, and some cabbage. On her way home, the farmer came to the bank of a river and rented a boat. But crossing the river by boat, the farmer could carry only herself and a single one of her purchases: the wolf, the goat, or the cabbage.
If left unattended together, the wolf would eat the goat, or the goat would eat the cabbage.
The farmer's challenge was to carry herself and her purchases to the far bank of the river, leaving each purchase intact. How did she do it?
